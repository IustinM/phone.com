            <button class="accordion ">What is VoIP?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>VoIP stands for Voice Over Internet Protocol—which means that instead of using a phone line from a phone company, Phone.com’s VoIP software allows you to use the internet to make audio and video calls from your laptop, smartphone, office phone, and more.

                    For a small business phone service, VoIP technology, also known as internet telephony, takes the voice or video transmission, turns them into data packets that move across the internet and change back into audio at the other end. In the ever-changing business landscape, VoIP has become an easy and affordable method for small businesses to run their phone system. What makes it so important is that it isn’t just for voice calls, it works for SMS messaging, video, and even faxing.</p>
                
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Is Phone.com HIPAA compliant?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Yes! Your Phone.com service comes HIPAA and HITECH compliant, guaranteed thanks to a partnership with the Compliancy Group. Phone.com offers compliancy for your medical office, big or small and also offers Business Associate Agreements (BAA) if applicable, which can be a common violation if you don’t have one.

            <button class="accordion">How can I use a custom toll vanity for my business?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Phone.com offers vanity toll-free or vanity-800 numbers to our customers. Vanity toll-free numbers boost your brand recognition instantly by giving your company a big business feel. Also, the easier it is for your customers to dial your phone number—either by making the numbers easy to remember (800-555-5000), or by using letters associated with your business (800-FLOWERS)—the more recognizable your brand becomes.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Our number porting specialists will determine if your current phone number can be moved over to Phone.com. If so, the transfer is easy to request and usually takes 10 to 15 business days. It can take up to 60 days in extreme cases. Phone.com does give you a temporary number while your porting is in process. If your current provider offers call forwarding you can make sure the temporary number forwards to your Phone.com account.</p>

                    Once you’ve created this extension, go to the settings in your Phone.com iPhone app to enable VoIP calling.
