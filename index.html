            <div class="dropdown-container2">
                <p>VoIP stands for Voice Over Internet Protocol—which means that instead of using a phone line from a phone company, Phone.com’s VoIP software allows you to use the internet to make audio and video calls from your laptop, smartphone, office phone, and more.

                    For a small business phone service, VoIP technology, also known as internet telephony, takes the voice or video transmission, turns them into data packets that move across the internet and change back into audio at the other end. In the ever-changing business landscape, VoIP has become an easy and affordable method for small businesses to run their phone system. What makes it so important is that it isn’t just for voice calls, it works for SMS messaging, video, and even faxing.

            <div class="dropdown-container2">
                <p>Yes! Your Phone.com service comes HIPAA and HITECH compliant, guaranteed thanks to a partnership with the Compliancy Group. Phone.com offers compliancy for your medical office, big or small and also offers Business Associate Agreements (BAA) if applicable, which can be a common violation if you don’t have one.

            <div class="dropdown-container2">
                <p>Phone.com offers vanity toll-free or vanity-800 numbers to our customers. Vanity toll-free numbers boost your brand recognition instantly by giving your company a big business feel. Also, the easier it is for your customers to dial your phone number—either by making the numbers easy to remember (800-555-5000), or by using letters associated with your business (800-FLOWERS)—the more recognizable your brand becomes.

                <p>Our number porting specialists will determine if your current phone number can be moved over to Phone.com. If so, the transfer is easy to request and usually takes 10 to 15 business days. It can take up to 60 days in extreme cases. Phone.com does give you a temporary number while your porting is in process. If your current provider offers call forwarding you can make sure the temporary number forwards to your Phone.com account.

                <p>Using the Phone.com Mobile App

                    To connect, you will need to enter your Phone.com phone number, your extension and your voicemail password, which is stored in your Phone.com voicemail settings.
                    
                    Using our mobile app lets you place calls through Phone.com using your cell phone’s mobile connection. Assuming you are on either WiFi or a mobile data connection, you can also access your Phone.com address book, call logs, inbox, conference calling and SMS functions.
                    
                    Downloading the Mobile App
                    
                    You can download and install our mobile app for iOS from the Apple Store and for Android from the Google Play Store.
                    
                    When you first launch the mobile app, you will be prompted to enter details for your Phone.com account, including your mobile phone number, your Phone.com phone number and your voicemail password.
                    
                    This allows you to receive and make calls using your Phone.com account on your mobile phone. The setup procedure will differ slightly depending on your based on your device’s operating system and the version of the app you are using. </p>

            <div class="dropdown-container2">
                <p>Start getting calls on your Phone.com service—it’s as easy as adding an extension and connecting your phone number to that extension.

                    When you add an extension, you can choose to add a phone, softphone or virtual extension. If all you want to do is receive calls on your cell phone, then add a virtual extension.
                    
                    Once you are in the settings for that new extension (found in your account by going to Configure, then Manage Users and Extensions), you can set voicemail and notification settings, as well as call handling rules to forward calls to your mobile phone.
                    
                    You are now ready to receive calls at your Phone.com number. Make sure to do a test call to your number from another phone to make sure you have set up your extension and number correctly.
                    
                    Thankfully there are many options for setting up your Phone.com account. We recommend figuring out exactly what you need your system to do and how you’d like calls to be directed.
                    
                    Once you have a plan, you can set up the greetings, extensions, menus, queues and other phone numbers that you need to set up.
